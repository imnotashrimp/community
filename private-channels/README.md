# A Quick Run Down on Private Communication

The primary goal for Logzio Community is to foster discussions. These discussions may be open to all or they might be something that is specific to only a small group of people _or_ if you want to share code or environment configurations with only a few other people rather than the community at large. There are a few ways to do that:

* A group DM (direct message)
* A private channel
* Changing scope of a public channel to a private channel

Which of these will work out best depends a little on the context of your conversation.

## Group DMs

A group DM is when you directly message a group of people. This is useful for small groups of conversation that other people won't need to reference later. For example, if Jayne needs to talk to Simon and River about what happened on Ariel, he might choose to do so in a group DM. No one in the group DM can add another person, so that ensures that this conversation stays private. If Simon wants to clue in Mal and tries to add Mal to the group DM, then Slack will actually just make a new group DM with four members instead of three. 

## Create a Private Channel

If Jayne had started a private channel to discuss Ariel with Simon and River, then any one of them could add Mal to the private channel at any time. Since the channel is private Mal couldn't find it on his own - he'd need to be added by one of the current members. When you add someone to a private channel you can choose whether or not to expose a channel's history to them. So it's a bit of a race - if River adds Mal she'll probably want him to see the channel history (Simon is too nice for that), but if Jayne adds him then Jayne'll probably want to hide the channel history. In that latter case, Slack will archive the existing private channel and make a new private channel of the same name and member list. In this case, Mal will not be able to see the private, now archived, history.

So if you're in a situation where you are communicating with a small group and need to add a member, make sure you mindfully choose whether or not to expose the channel's history when you add them.

## Convert a Public Channel to Private

[How to convert a public channel to private (Slack Documentation)](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/213185467-Make-a-public-channel-private)

Perhaps what started as an open discussion needs to be converted to a private one (we're looking at you Simon and Kaylee). So to take that discussion offline, so to speak, either of them can convert the public channel to private. Note that since private channels _cannot_ be made public that this action is irreversable: so once that channel is private, it's private and the same rules with adding members / exposing channel history / etc. apply as above. When converting a public channel to private you may notice it takes a few minutes for the history to reappear. That's normal and expected. Something to be careful of though: files that were shared when the channel was public will remain public. So if Simon puts someone's medical records in a channel, realizes his error, and makes the channel private the file that he exposed is still public and in this case would probably need to be deleted.
